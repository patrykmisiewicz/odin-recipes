        <h2>What Is Fish and Chips?</h2>

        <p>Fish and chips is a traditional British dish consisting of fried fish and thinly sliced fried potatoes. The potatoes are called "French fries" in the U.S. and "chips" in the U.K. Many food historians think the first fish and chips shop was opened by Joseph Malin, a young Jewish immigrant, in London in the 1860s. His shop was so popular, it remained open until the 1970s.</p>

            <li>Make the chips by slicing and frying the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Make the batter by mixing the flour, baking powder, seasonings, milk, and egg.</li>

            <li>Fry the fish until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Fry the potatoes a second time, then serve alongside the fried fish.</li>

        <h2>How to Store Fish and Chips</h2>

        <p>If you have leftover fish and chips, transfer the dish to a paper towel-lined storage container and store it in the refrigerator for up to three days.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>How to Reheat Fish and Chips</h2>

        <p>This dish is best served fresh, as the fish and chips are crispiest straight out of the fryer. If you have leftovers, though, you can make them crispy and delicious again by patting them dry with paper towels and reheating them on the stove instead of in the microwave.</p>

        <p>"Easy, nice, and crispy batter," according to <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/7184734">dakman</a>. "I would add additional spices like garlic salt instead of just salt, but this one is a keeper."</p>
        
        <p>"This turned out great," raves <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/2665303">Sandy Cramer</a>. "I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. It was crispy and delicious. I think the key is to make sure your fish is not too wet. I dried the fish thoroughly and it came out just the way we like it."</p>
